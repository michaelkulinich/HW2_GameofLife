## Description
The game of Life was designed in the 1970s by the mathematician J.H. Conway. The game gained popularity after appearing in a Scientific American article, and took the computing world by storm. The game is a simulation that models the life cycle of bacteria, providing entertainment wrapped up in what some would call mathematical elegance. (For some history on the game, as well as the rise of computing in general, Hackers, by S. Levy.)

The game itself is played on a two-dimensional grid. Each grid location is either empty or occupied by a single cell (X). A locationâ€™s neighbors are any of the cells in the surrounding eight adjacent locations. (At this point you should be thinking about 2-d arrays.)
